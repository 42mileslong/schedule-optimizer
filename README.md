#   Schedule Optimizer

Schedule Optimizer is a web platform that allows students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to browse available courses and automatically build conflict-free schedules. The traditional registration process is complicated, frustrating, and often results in imperfect schedules - we hope to fix that.
